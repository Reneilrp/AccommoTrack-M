**AccommoTrack** is a comprehensive property management and booking platform tailored for dormitories, boarding houses, and bedspace rentals. Ideally designed to bridge the gap between landlords and student or professional tenants, the system modernizes the accommodation hunting and management experience.

The platform consists of a **Laravel** backend API, a **React Native (Expo)** mobile application for tenants/users, and a **React (Vite)** web dashboard for landlords and administrators.
